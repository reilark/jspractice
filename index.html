        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am striving to learn and practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding. I still have much to learn, and will improve
            this page as my ability improves.

        <p>More will go here eventually, but not now. I need to review HTML5 and some CSS things to back on top of things.
